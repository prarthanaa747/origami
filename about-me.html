       ABOUT US</h3>
        
        <p>I have an origami studio but I always wanted to show my creativity online. 
            So I finally decided to make a website of her own. This is also for people 
            who want to know what my studio is about before making big decisions to pay for anything.
            you can also learn how to do it her if your too far away to come to my studio. my only intention is to 
            share my love of art and origami with the world so join me if your bored instead of going
            out and save a few lives</p2>
